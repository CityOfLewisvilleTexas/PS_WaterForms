## Water Forms and Reports
Water Forms and Reports is the root page for the Water Plant's applications. There are several sections that collapse containing links to the various reports and applications used by operators and supervisors for plant operations. Folders are organized by their Psofia form number i.e. Form #36 is the Rounds Sheet application and is located under apps.cityoflewsiville.com/WaterForms/36/index.html. If it is a report and not an entry form then the containing folder is named with a more descriptive title.

* **Dosages frame** - this is a live tool that updates frequently displaying any setpoint requirements from water plant supervisors and is meant to be a visual reference for operators.
* **Lab** - this section contains the reports that link to the Psofia entry forms for bi-hourly rounds. Daily water analysis is where pH, alkalinity, and turbidity are recorded for various parts of the plant. Daily chlorine residual report is where chlorine residual and chlorine/ammonia ratio data is recorded.
* **Rounds** -  Contains the main bi-hourly rounds entry application built for the tablet. This is meant to be used on the toughbook tablet when carried around the plant grounds and hits the Psofia API for entering data instead of using a Psofia form. The Flow Calculator is a copy of the one in the Rounds Sheet application.
* **Clipboards** - In order to conserve some resemblance to the old system that operators were familiar with, this section is named 'clipboards' because these are the forms that were once all on clipboards. This section contains several of the forms the 'inside' operator fills out including Flouride, pH Probe and Turbidimeter Calibration, CT, Color/Odor, Turbidimeter (tabletop) Calibration, Clearwells, Clarifiers, and weekly Manganese, Iron, Nitrate, and Free Ammonia forms.
* **Midnight Paperwork** - Includes everything the night shift is responsible for: Bleach/LAS levels, Monthly Electrical Readings, Monthly Meter Readings, Monthly Pump Hours, and SWMOR (monthly TCEQ Report).
* **Filters** - Contains the filter related forms like which are running, turbidity, backwash, and hours.
* **Weekly** - Includes the weekly chemical inventory form, and weekly memo to the foreman.
* **Monthly** -
